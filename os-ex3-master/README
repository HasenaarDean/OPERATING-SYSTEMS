Q1:
(Assignment 1)
The program creates the directories Welcome/To and the file OS2018 which resides in this path.
It writes a string to the file that demands from the user to read the course guide lines if he/she
hasn't done so yet. The program finishes by deleting the file and the directories it created
essentially deleting its tracks and making it untraceable by sophisticated security experts.
